# Static Site Generator and Frameworks

## Overview

Front Matter's goal is not to be opinionated on which static site generator or framework you are using. We want to support all of them out there, but they can have their requirements, configurations, ...

In this section of the documentation, we will list them up and tell more about how you can get started.

## Support additional file types

As there are many static site generators out there, we probably do not support all the file types by default. However, you do not have to worry, if there is a file type you want to support, you can easily add it to the `frontMatter.content.supportedFileTypes` setting.

By default, Front Matter supports: `md`, `markdown`, and `mdx`. If you want to support other types, just add these to the `frontMatter.content.supportedFileTypes` setting.

```json
{
  "frontMatter.content.supportedFileTypes": [ "md", "markdown", "mdx", "svx" ]
}
```
