# Docusaurus Configuration

## Setting up Front Matter for your Docusaurus site

Start by opening your Docusaurus project in Visual Studio Code. 

> **Info**: For this article, you can create an empty project with the command: npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic.

The welcome dashboard appears if this is the first time you use Front Matter. 

If you have already installed or used Front Matter before, you can open the dashboard by executing the `Front Matter: Open dashboard` command. The steps to perform go as follows:

- Open the command prompt:
  - Windows `⇧+ctrl+P`
  - Mac: `⇧+⌘+P`
- Type: `Front Matter` and pick the `Front Matter: Open dashboard` command.

The welcome dashboard looks as follows:

## Configuration of Front Matter

### Project initialization

On the welcome screen, click on the `Initialize project` action. This action creates the `.frontmatter` folder and `frontmatter.json` file in the current project.

### Framework or static-site generator

Next is to let Front Matter know which framework or static-site generator you use. In this case, we will pick **Hugo**.

### Content folders

Content folders are the locations where Front Matter needs to know where to create your `markdown` pages. 

To configure this, you need to open the `explorer panel` and perform the following steps:

- Right-click on the folder you want to add;
- From the folder menu, click on `Front Matter: Register folder`;

- Front Matter will ask you what name you want to give this folder. By default, it will take the same name as the added folder.

- Once you complete this step, Front Matter's configuration is completed and opens the content dashboard.

> **Info**: You can perform these steps for one folder or many. For instance, if you have multiple content types like blogs, posts, articles, news, etc. You can register each folder the same way.

## Using Front Matter

Now that Front Matter is configured, you can start creating content or managing your content via the Front Matter panel.
